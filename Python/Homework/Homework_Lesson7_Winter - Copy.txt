print("\nstart: Correct change")
# 2.   (40pts) Write a program that will calculate the correct change to give back to a shopper at a 
# fruit market. Set up a class fruit to do this. The class ‘fruit’ will have three attributes 
# (variables): name, price, and number, as well as two methods: addFruit and totalCost (for 
# that type of fruit).  

class fruit:
    # when object is initiated....
    def __init__(self, nm, pr):
    # variables: attributes in fruit
        self.name = nm
        self.price = pr
        self.number = []
        # list for methods

# With a while loop, ask the user how much of each fruit they would like to buy, one fruit at a 
# time. In other words, ask how many apples, how many oranges, how many mangoes. Then 
# show them what they have in their cart, and ask them if they would like to continue 
# shopping. If yes, cycle back through so they can add more fruit. If no, exit the loop and tell 
# them their total cost (there is no sales tax in PA on fruit).
