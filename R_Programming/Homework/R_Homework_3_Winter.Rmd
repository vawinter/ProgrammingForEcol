```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Question 1

1) Using the “iris” dataset, you will be making two different plots that visualize
differences between the three species of iris. You can get the iris dataset by typing:


```{r iris}
data(iris)

# Load in libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Question 1a

 a) Make a scatterplot with sepal width on the x axis and sepal length on the y axis.
 Color code each species. Add axes labels. Pick a theme. Change the font size of
 the different elements to your liking. Make any other adjustments you want to
 make the figure appealing to you. Include both the code and the final figure in
 your answer.
 

### Answer:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot1 <- iris %>% 
  # plot iris data set with following aesthetics
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, col = Species)) +
  # change point size
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  # change labels
  labs(x = "Sepal Width",
       y = "Sepa Length",
       title = "Question 1a graph") +
  # theme
  theme_bw() +
  # change text size and font
  theme(text=element_text(size=16,  family="mono")) +
  # center title
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

plot1
```

## Question 1b

b) Use a different type of plot to visualize some part of the iris data and edit it to 
make it look “publication ready”. Include both the code and the final figure in 
your answer. 



### Answer:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot2 <- iris %>% 
  # plot iris data set with following aesthetics
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, fill  = Species)) +
  # change point size
  geom_boxplot() +
  # change labels
  labs(x = "Sepal Width",
       y = "Sepa Length",
       title = "Question 1b graph") +
  # theme
  theme_classic() +
  # change text size and font
  theme(text=element_text(size=16,  family="serif")) +
  # center title
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 

plot2
```
### Question 2

2) Find a figure you like in a publication or newspaper. Write out all the different 
layers that would be required to generate it in ggplot2. Think of this as a pseudocode 
exercise, but for graphics. 


```{r image, fig.cap="Figure 5: Fieberg et al. 2017", fig.align='center', out.width='100%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/figure.png")
```


### Answer:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# # Library to arrange plots
# library(gridExtra)
# 
# # Plot A
# a <- data %>% 
#   ggplot() +
#   # Smooth linear regression line of data
#   geom_smooth(aes(x = Temperature, y = Density), col = "grey", method = "lm") +
#   # black line
#   geom_line(aes(x = Temperature, y = Density), col = "black") +
#   # red dashed line
#   geom_smooth(aes(x = Temperature, y = Density), col = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
#   # labels
#   labs(x = "Temperature",
#        y = "Denisty",
#        title = " y ~ temp",
#        subtitle = "(A)") +
#   # y axis limit
#   ylim(c(0, 0.8)) +
#   # x axis limit
#   xlim(c(-4, 4)) +
#   # theme?
#   theme_minimal() +
#   # center title
#   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
# 
# # Plot B
# b <- data %>% 
#   ggplot() +
#    # Smooth linear regression line of data
#   geom_smooth(aes(x = Temperature, y = Density), col = "grey", method = "lm") +
#   # black line
#   geom_line(aes(x = Temperature, y = Density), col = "black") +
#   # red dashed line
#   geom_smooth(aes(x = Temperature, y = Density), col = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
#   # labels
#   labs(x = "Temperature",
#        y = "Denisty",
#        title = " y ~ temp + temp^2",
#        subtitle = "(B)") +
#   # y axis limit
#   ylim(c(0, 0.8)) +
#   # x axis limit
#   xlim(c(-4, 4)) +
#   # theme?
#   theme_minimal()
#   # center title
#   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
# 
# # Put plots together
# plot_full <- grid.arrange(a, b)
```
